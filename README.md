A simple widget that displays all colors and names of a given color scheme.

I created this package to help me see the colors that are generated by the `ColorScheme.fromSeed` factory function
in combination with the `DynamicSchemeVariant` property.
It's intended to be used for debugging purposes, to help you as a developer find out which colors are
available and their names. It's not intended to be used in production code.

## Features

* Displays all the colors of a given color scheme as well as the color's name.
* If no color scheme is provided, it will use the default color scheme of the current theme.
* Scales and uses as much screen estate as possible.
* Background and text colors can be set, but will default to `surface` and `onSurface` respectively.

## Getting started

Have only tried this package with Material 3, I believe it should work with Material 2 as well but
several colors will be missing.

## Usage

This package creates a widget, so use it as you would any other widget, but preferably with as much
screen estate available as possible.

```dart
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final colorScheme = ColorScheme.fromSeed(seedColor: const Color(0xFF2FB2B2), brightness: Brightness.light, dynamicSchemeVariant: DynamicSchemeVariant.tonalSpot);
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Color Scheme Display Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        colorScheme: colorScheme,
        useMaterial3: true,
      ),
      home: const ColorSchemeDisplay(),
    );
  }
}
```
