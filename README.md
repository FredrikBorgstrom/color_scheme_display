A simple widget that displays all colors in a given color scheme.

I created this package to help me see the colors that are generated by the `ColorScheme.fromSeed` factory function
in combination with the `DynamicSchemeVariant` property.

## Features

Will scale to fit the screen, and display all colors in a given color scheme.
Background and text color can be set, but will default to `surface` and `onSurface` respectively.
